# Platform-Fall
This game was created for Ludum Dare 49 - Unstable.
The code may or may not work out of the box.
The data archive must be downloaded from the release build and placed next to the binaries.

It is based on our self made ChaosFramework, which provides the means to update and render a game as well as a physics engine, but contains no game code itself.

All assets and game code were created within 48 hours.
